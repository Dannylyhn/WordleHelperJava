# WordleHelper
I want to create an application to help me with the daily Wordle. 

First, I implemented a function to loop through the words in a txt file and add them to a list. 

Then I implemented another function which uses the list and check if the input word from the user matches. 
In that function, maybe I should remove all the words that contains the letters which is not a part of the goal word. 
Maybe I should sort it in the first function before puttng it in a list to give a smaller list to work with.
