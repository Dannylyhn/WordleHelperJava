# WordleHelper
I want to create an application to help me with the daily Wordle. 

First, I found a text file containing 5 letter words


Possible solution:
Loop through the list of words and check if the word contains the correct char needed. 
else remove word from list 
Do this till satisfaction (5 times max)
